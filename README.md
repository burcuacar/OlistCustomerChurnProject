In this study, a combination of customer segmentation and machine learning techniques was applied using a public dataset from the Brazilian e-commerce company Olist to enhance churn prediction and provide a more comprehensive analysis of customer churn. Customer segmentation was performed using RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis comparing with K-Means clustering algorithm to identify well-defined customer segments. These segments were then used for machine learning models to enhance churn prediction.
